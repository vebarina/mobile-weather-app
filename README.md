# Welcome to my mobile weather app! 👋

I have recently started learning **JavaScript** and **React**, and wanted to create simple projects to learn more while actually _doing_. This weather app is the third of a series of other web and mobile apps I intend to build to get more experience and skills, which will help me to be ready for real world projects. In this case, I used **React Native**, since I wanted to learn a bit about it.

In this app, you can **select** a country from the dropdown list, and some basic information about the _current weather_ will be displayed.

You can check out my other projects [here](https://github.com/vebarina?tab=repositories).
